# EDPC
## What is it?
EDPC stands for "Every Day Pencil Case", it is a pocket-sized pencil case that should just carry the essentials(eg. pencil, eraser, pencil sharpener).

## Who can make modules?
Anyone design modules for this pencil case, I believe that if you have an improvement or an addition you should be free to do so.

## What does the future hold for this project?
I aim to keep refining and adding to this project. Good luck if you use the pencil case!
